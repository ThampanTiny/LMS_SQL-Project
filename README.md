**Library Management System - SQL Project**

This **Library Management System** project is designed to efficiently manage a library's operations using a relational database implemented in SQL. The system includes the management of books, customers, and book issuance/return activities. It provides insights into the library's data through queries and handles tasks like adding, retrieving, updating, and managing records systematically.

**Key Features**:
1. **Book Management**: Tracks book details such as title, category, author, rental price, availability, and publisher.
2. **Customer Management**: Maintains customer information, including name, address, registration date, and activity history.
3. **Issuance and Return Records**: Logs details of issued and returned books, including associated customers and dates.
4. **Comprehensive Queries**: Retrieve information such as:
     - Total count of books in categories.
     - Customers who have issued books.
     - Books issued during specific periods.
5. **Trigger Implementation**: Enforces rules for data integrity (e.g., prevents negative rental prices).
6. **Advanced Procedures**: Stored procedures for efficient operations like updating departments, calculating averages, and retrieving counts.
7. **Dynamic Views**: Simplifies the presentation of customer and book data for better usability.


**Technologies Used**

1. **Database**: MySQL
2. **Concepts**: Joins and Subqueries.

This project is ideal for learning database management and simulating a real-world library system with a focus on optimizing operations through SQL.
